# Interact 2012 #

This directory contains the Lua and perl scripts used in the "Advanced Operational Concepts with Momentum" talk I gave at interact 2012 for reference purposes only.  

As I said in the talk, these do not represent best practice - as the point in most cases was for them to break so we could analyze the impact and then discuss improvements.  These scripts reflect the post-improvement state - but only in that one area. In particular, to make it easier to present the policy we built was broken up into lots of little pieces.  Ideally they would all be in one policy script, and some of the internals would be broken out into private functions (particularly around the binding logic).

So use the concepts if they are helpful, but pleaes do not put them into production "as-is".  As with everything else in this repository - they are offered under the BSD license, with no warranties expressed or implied.  If they break, you get to keep all the pieces.
